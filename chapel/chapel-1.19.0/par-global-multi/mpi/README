This version attempts to mitigate the NUMA effects by using MPI as a conduit.
Unfortunately, it is not possible to get more than one core (2 hyperthreads) on
a node.

Use the script chpl2cluster to launch the application:

./chpl2cluster -nl 1

This will use the 'cluster.job' file to launch the script 'run' that in
the end calls 'heat_dissipation' (which in the end calls
'heat_dissipation_real').
