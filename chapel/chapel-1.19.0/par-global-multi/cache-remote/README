This version adds the --cache-remote flag.  The program contains a distributed
array wrapped in an object to be able to do a pointer swap.  One of the
hypotheses is that a remote access is expensive because the object that resides
on the main locale must be accessed each time.  This flag can make this pattern
perform better.

This flag does not appear to improve the performance.
