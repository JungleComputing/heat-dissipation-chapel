This version removes the 'distributed array in a class' pattern that allows one
to use the <=> swap operator on the objects effectively creating a pointer
swap.  Instead, this version unrolls the loop by 2 and swaps the arrays by
calling a procedure with the arrays swapped.

This version does not improve the performance.
